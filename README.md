# Welcome to Wait Time Now

Wait Time Now is built to crowdsource wait time to enter a store during Covid-19 outbreak. As many stores start to limit the number of people in their stores to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of Covid-19, the queue to enter the store is getting longer. Many of us would like to get near real time infos about the wait time for stores before heading out.

## Share the wait time by TEXTing it to (415)319-9114

#### TEXT format: Target 2800 Dublin Blvd Dublin CA 20 mins

We collect the infos and share it on **[here](wait_time.md).**

Thank you for helping our community in this time of need.
