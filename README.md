# Welcome to Wait Time Now

#### Wait Time Now is built to crowdsource wait time to enter a store or checkout during Covid-19 outbreak. 

#### As many stores start to limit the number of people in their stores to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of Covid-19, the queue to enter the store is getting longer. Many of us would like to get near real time infos about the wait time for stores before heading out.

## Share the wait time by TEXTing it to (415)319-9114

### TEXT format: Target 2800 Dublin Blvd Dublin CA 20 mins
